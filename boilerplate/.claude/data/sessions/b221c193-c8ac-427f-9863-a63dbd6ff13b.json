    "out of curiosity: I've seen a few issues with claude code hooks that it cannot find the hook file. currently the hooks are configured with relative paths in project root (like .claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py). but the real path is /Users/neil/src/solo/cc-boilderplate/.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py) can this been an issue when claude 'losses' its orientation in which directory it is? research claude code documentation and github issues if this is valid / how to circumvent file not found issues with hooks.",
