    "review our current project harshly and use our code-reviewer-agent. I want to make sure your main focus is still providing a very compact and focussed claude code boilerplate. no cruft, no shiny-object-syndrom. every line of code/text, every feature with a clear impact and reasoned value add.",
    "this has been a little to compact, may be due to your configured output-style. I've changed the style. please represent your plan with more explanation why you come to those conclusions. i like the ruthless approach, but need to understand more of the reasoning.",
    "this is way to minimal. do this review again, but be less harsh. reason more extensive for me to understand what the value add is in reducing this, besides 'it's less, therefor better'. this project has a purpose and every component should (not verified, this is your task) add value. so please identify and reason what the value is and suggest, out of your conclusions, if we should: kill it (YAGNI), reduce complexity (KISS) or leave it as 'perfect fit'.",
