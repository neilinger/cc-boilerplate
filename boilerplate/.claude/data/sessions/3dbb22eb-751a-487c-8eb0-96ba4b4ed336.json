    "I think this is a good addition to baseline worker agents, especially when simple commands will not suffice anymore, or there are more complex cases. having this in a small but very good sub-agent worflow would train this 'can it be delegated? yes? do so'-gene of us, so we think first of delegation than doing it ourselves (as it is repeatable from step 1 when we delegate).",
    "do not disclose our realignment as the user does not know about that. when we think about this feature, let's think deep. reevaluate if github-mcp would improve things or just adds to cruft.",
