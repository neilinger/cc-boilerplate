    "ok. the whole reason for doing this is to react to a git actions error. you tell me now, that it is finished. question is: how did you verify that and ensured that this is actually true? what is missing?",
    "good. we have talked about our branching strategy. can you remind my what we agreed upon? but before we do that: i see a lot of documentations in @docs/ that are UPPER-case and do not seem to follow any structure. additionally they are not linked or cross referenced in our main documentations. i think we violated KISS/YAGNI on this one, as we should have adhered to naming conventions and to focus on improving what we have instead of creating new (modify before new). how can we a)fix this ad-hoc b)persist this in our current documentation/principles/adr/governance approach.",
    "I've an opinion to @docs/adr/ADR-004-documentation-standards.md: ADR should be a little bit more focussed and distinct in terms of 'migration plans'. for me the migration planning / thoughts should be done via PRP capabilities (creating new PRPs or extending already available ones) and not in decision records on architectural level (as they, IMHO, explicitly exclude operationsal/tactical components). but i am not the expert on this things. please research, review and reason with me on what the best approach is regarding Scope of ADR and when to cut over to a additional pattern to keep destinct seperation of concerns.",
    "yes, please do that. but before you continue with that i want you to make sure, that we persist this research in actionable expertiese. my train of thought is to define and document this seperation of concerns between ADR and PRP, aswell as building an ADR-Template and an ADR command (or agent?) that assists every time we want to create an ADR. Similar to creating a PRP. remeber to adjust @CLAUDE.md aswell regarding ADR (similar to PRP) to have the same systemic approach for those 2 seperated concerns.",
    "a few comments on @PRPs/PRP-001-documentation-migration.md - when you mention other documents: use markdown capabilities to acutally link them please. your success-definition: - All docs follow lowercase-hyphen naming -> this is called kebab-case (use research to verify). this is an example to remind you to be explicit and specific when you reference things. call them by their (specific) name or concept. add sources if not obvious. another example: ## Why\n\n- **Consistency**: Follow industry conventions for file naming\\\n\\\n---\\\nwhich industry standard? do you mean kebab-case? or is there a standard I'm not aware of (which is very likely). if so, please reference/call it by name to be specific!",
    "please research in detail if this referenced best practice for markdown really is 'best practice'. https://medium.com/geekculture/markdown-best-practices-911be77a1282. please cross reference with other documentation maybe more reliable sources like google developer, github/gitlab or major AI-LLM Provider (as they rely on Markdown very much) and such sources inside the developer community.",
    "extracting this knowledge: can we add this to our automatic linting (if we have any) for markdown? can we add this as additional information for our review-agent(s) and documentation generation agents? please review our cureent documentation(s) and or templates if they adhere to it. suggest improvements i have missed.",
    "continue",
    "i do not want an additional mardown linter script i have to maintain later on. also the 80 characters rule seems to be a little 'power-motive' thingy, when a linter can just fix this automatically. so the question is: which linter to add to pre commit hook to 'just' verify/fix the markdown. as the user is using visual studio code this will help in this endavour aswell.",
    "ok. no let us resume our tasks we had before we optimized the linting-approach. we still have not tackled the current documentation issues."
