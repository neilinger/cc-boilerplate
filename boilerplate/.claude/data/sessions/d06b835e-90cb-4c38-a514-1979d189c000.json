    "what is the next step if i want to make the release 'official' so i can be used easily. do we do tags? or do we need to merge sth into main? advice me on how to approach this compliante to our process for release/merge/git operations.",
    "ok. I've done the process to feature PR to release PR. how can i close the gap to release -> main PR? there seems to be a missing link for me. is there a lack of documentation, or is there a command missing? or am i just not experienced enough in this matter?",
    "ok. we need to do another review on this, lets be quick about this. use KISS/YAGNI and think about adding this to the existing commands for it. but you can then ask or deduct in which step we are on the way."
