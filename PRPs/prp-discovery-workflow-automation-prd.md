# PRD: PRP Discovery Workflow Automation System

## Executive Summary

**Product Name**: PRP Discovery Workflow Automation System
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-01-20
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

### Problem Statement
Development teams spend 4-6 hours manually creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), often producing incomplete documentation that leads to implementation blockers, scope creep, and failed deliveries. Current manual processes lack structured discovery, visual documentation, and seamless handoff to implementation workflows.

### Solution Overview
An automated PRD discovery system that transforms rough ideas into comprehensive, implementation-ready documentation through a structured 3-phase discovery process, leveraging Claude Code's hierarchical agent architecture for intelligent research, analysis, and documentation generation.

### Success Metrics
- **Time Reduction**: 75% reduction in PRD creation time (from 4-6 hours to 1-1.5 hours)
- **Quality Improvement**: 90% reduction in implementation blockers due to incomplete requirements
- **Process Efficiency**: 100% of PRDs include visual documentation and spec-kit compatibility
- **Developer Satisfaction**: 85% improvement in developer confidence with requirement clarity

## Problem & Solution

### Current State Pain Points
1. **Manual Discovery**: Unstructured brainstorming leads to missed requirements and unclear scope
2. **Incomplete Documentation**: PRDs lack visual flows, technical specifications, and implementation guidance
3. **Poor Handoff**: No standardized transition from requirements to implementation planning
4. **Quality Inconsistency**: PRD quality varies significantly across teams and projects
5. **Time Inefficiency**: Repetitive research and documentation work across similar projects

### Proposed Solution
A structured, agent-orchestrated PRD discovery workflow that:
- **Automates Research**: Technical-researcher agent conducts market analysis and best practices research
- **Structures Discovery**: 3-phase process ensures comprehensive requirement gathering
- **Generates Visuals**: Automatic Mermaid diagram creation for user flows and system architecture
- **Validates Quality**: Built-in checklist ensures implementation readiness
- **Enables Handoff**: Direct integration with spec-kit workflow for seamless transition
