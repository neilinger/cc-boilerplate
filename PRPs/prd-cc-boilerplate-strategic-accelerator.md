# CC-Boilerplate Strategic Accelerator Framework
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### **Product Vision**
"Get in and out of any messy situation" - CC-Boilerplate is the ultimate Swiss Army knife for AI-first turnaround management, enabling rapid recovery from chaos and systematic acceleration of any development initiative.

### **Mission Statement**
Transform brown-field disasters and greenfield opportunities into production-ready systems within hours, not weeks, while maintaining enterprise-grade quality and security standards.

### **Strategic Positioning**
CC-Boilerplate positions as the **strategic accelerator framework** for:
- **Turnaround Management**: Rescuing complex projects that have lost focus
- **Consulting Acceleration**: Rapid prototyping and delivery for client engagements
- **Portfolio Development**: Internal tool creation for portfolio companies
- **Venture Founding**: Greenfield AI-first company creation

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### **Primary Problem: Brown-Field Turnaround Chaos**
Complex projects like TIIEE develop massive complexity, lose focus, require extensive maintenance, and suffer from:
- **Scope Bleed**: "Hey Joe, I have an idea" syndrome
- **Separation of Concerns Mess**: Implementation mixed with requirements
- **Intent-to-Implementation Drift**: What was planned ≠ what was built
- **Last 20% Burden**: Maintenance consumes 80% of effort

### **Secondary Problem: Consulting Velocity Constraints**
Client engagements require immediate productive deployment:
- **Onboarding Friction**: Getting productive takes days/weeks
- **Quality vs Speed**: High standards slow movement
- **Standard Divergence**: Each project reinvents the wheel
- **Trust vs Verify**: Need to start immediately while ensuring compliance

### **Tertiary Problem: Human Messiness**
"Humans are messy" - developers and teams inevitably create situations requiring rescue:
- **Mid-Journey Mistakes**: Wrong branch, mixed implementations, broken workflows
- **Context Loss**: Losing track of why decisions were made
- **Quality Drift**: Standards erosion under pressure
- **Recovery Difficulty**: Hard to get back on track

---

## 3. Solution Architecture

### **Core Philosophy: "Do One Thing Well"**
100+ battle-tested specialist agents, each mastering a specific domain, orchestrated through intelligent workflow management.

### **Four Pillars of Excellence**

#### **Pillar 1: Hierarchical Agent Orchestration**

```

#### **Pillar 2: Security-First Development**
- **30+ Dangerous Pattern Prevention**: Never `rm -rf /` disasters
- **Role-Based Tool Permissions**: Read-only agents cannot modify files
- **Mandatory Security Chains**: code-reviewer → security-orchestrator → security-scanner
- **Environment Protection**: Zero tolerance for secret exposure

#### **Pillar 3: Non-Blocking Quality Gates**
- **Trust But Verify**: Start immediately, course-correct continuously
- **Progressive Validation**: Quality gates that don't stop movement
- **Backfill Capability**: Fix architectural decisions mid-journey
- **KISS/YAGNI Enforcement**: Prevent over-engineering automatically

#### **Pillar 4: Mid-Journey Course Correction**
- **Smart Commit Recovery**: Split mixed implementations logically
- **Branch Workflow Repair**: Fix feature/release/main flow at any point
- **Context Reconstruction**: Regenerate specs/plans from existing code
- **Graceful Recovery**: Always a path back to clean state

## 6. Technical Architecture

### **Architecture Philosophy: Local CLI-First**

CC-Boilerplate is a CLI-based development assistant that drops directly into your local codebase. It operates entirely from the command line within your project directory, using Claude commands, local agents, and MCP servers for external integrations. There are no REST APIs or web services - everything runs locally as CLI tools and scripts.

**Key Principles:**
- **Local-First**: Runs entirely on developer machines, no cloud infrastructure required
- **CLI-Driven**: Uses Claude commands (/commands) for workflow orchestration
- **MCP Integration**: External services accessed via MCP servers, not REST APIs
- **Hook-Based Security**: Security implemented through local hooks and validation scripts
- **Drop-In Tool**: Integrates into any existing codebase without architectural changes
