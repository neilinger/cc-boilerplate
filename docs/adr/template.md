# ADR-XXX: [Brief Decision Title]

**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: [List of people who participated in this decision]

## Context

Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. This section should explain:

- What problem are we trying to solve?
- What constraints exist that limit our options?
- What requirements must be satisfied?
- What environmental factors influence this decision?

Keep this factual and objective. Avoid stating solutions here.

## Decision

State the architecture decision and explain why this particular solution was chosen.

This section should:
- Clearly state what we decided to do
- Explain the reasoning behind the decision
- Reference key factors from the Context section
- Include any important implementation details

## Consequences

Describe the resulting context after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed, not just the positive ones.

### Positive Consequences
- What becomes easier or better?
- What new capabilities does this enable?
- What problems does this solve?
- What benefits do we gain?

### Negative Consequences  
- What becomes harder or more complex?
- What new problems might this create?
- What limitations does this introduce?
- What risks are we accepting?

### Neutral Consequences
- What changes that are neither clearly positive nor negative?
- What trade-offs are we making?

## Alternatives Considered

List other options that were evaluated and explain why they were not chosen.

For each alternative:
- **Alternative Name**: Brief description
- **Pros**: Why this might be good
- **Cons**: Why we rejected it
- **Reason for rejection**: Specific factors that led to rejection

## Implementation Notes

Optional section for implementation-specific details:
- Key implementation steps
- Timeline or milestones
- Dependencies or prerequisites
- Success criteria

## References

Optional section for links to:
- Related ADRs
- External documentation
- Research or analysis that informed the decision
- Discussion threads or meeting notes

## Template Usage Instructions

1. **Copy this template** to create a new ADR
2. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** [like this] with actual content
3. **Number sequentially** (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.)
4. **Use kebab-case for filenames** (ADR-001-branching-strategy.md)
5. **Update the main README.md** index after creating
6. **Remove these instructions** from your final ADR

## Tips for Writing Good ADRs

- **Be specific**: Vague decisions lead to confusion later
- **Include context**: Future readers need to understand the situation
- **Document trade-offs**: All decisions have pros and cons
- **Use plain language**: Avoid unnecessary jargon
- **Keep it concise**: Aim for 1-2 pages maximum
- **Update status**: Mark as Accepted when implemented
