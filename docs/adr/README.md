# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the cc-boilerplate project. ADRs document important architectural and development workflow decisions to provide context and reasoning for future developers.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project, along with their context and consequences.

## Why do we use ADRs?

- **Context preservation**: Understanding why decisions were made
- **Team communication**: Share reasoning across team members
- **Decision tracking**: Maintain history of architectural evolution
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand project structure
- **Change management**: Provide basis for evaluating future changes

## ADR Format

All ADRs follow a consistent format defined in [template.md](template.md):

1. **Title**: Descriptive name for the decision
2. **Status**: Current state (Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded)
3. **Date**: When the decision was made
4. **Context**: The problem or opportunity that prompted the decision
5. **Decision**: What we decided to do and why
6. **Consequences**: Positive and negative impacts of the decision
7. **Alternatives**: Other options considered and why they were rejected

## Creating New ADRs

1. Copy the [template.md](template.md) file
2. Name it `adr-XXX-brief-title.md` (increment the number)
3. Fill out all sections completely
4. Update this README.md index
5. Commit and create pull request for review

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Decision is under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision is approved and being implemented
- **Rejected**: Decision was considered but not adopted
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer relevant
- **Superseded**: Decision was replaced by a newer ADR

## Guidelines for Good ADRs

### Do

- Write clearly and concisely
- Explain the business or technical context
- List the specific decision made
- Document both positive and negative consequences
- Include alternatives considered

### Don't

- Make decisions without documenting them
- Write overly technical content without context
- Skip the consequences section
- Forget to update the index

## Review Process

All ADRs should be:

1. Reviewed by at least one other team member
2. Discussed if the decision impacts multiple areas
3. Merged only after consensus is reached
4. Updated if circumstances change significantly

## Questions?

If you have questions about ADRs or need help creating one, refer to the [template.md](template.md) or review existing ADRs for examples.
