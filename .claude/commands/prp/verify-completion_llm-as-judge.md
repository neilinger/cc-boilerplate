# MAIN MISSION

my developer delivered the current state. verify and review harshly if we successfully implemented $ARGUMENTS - use all agents, mcps and commands you have at your disposal. this is the final check before releasing this version! this will define our brand and will be the cornerstone of customer percievance in terms of style, character, grit and quality. Make sure all Architecture Decision Records (ADR) in @docs/adr/ have been followed, or when diverging from it, reasoned and documented.

## NOTEs

- $ARGUMENTS should be a reference to a PRP file. if none has been provided: ask the user to provide one.
