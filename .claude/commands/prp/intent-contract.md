# Intent Contract Creation

## Feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Intent Contract Mission

Create a formal contract between stakeholders and implementation teams that defines clear expectations, boundaries, and success criteria before development begins.

**Position in Workflow**: This command creates intent contracts that clarify feature scope and prevent miscommunication. Use before implementation PRPs:
- User provides rough idea or requirement
- `/prp/intent-contract` → Creates formal intent contract with stakeholder alignment
- Stakeholders review and approve contract
- `/prp/create` → Creates implementation PRP based on approved contract

**Critical Understanding**: Intent contracts prevent:
- Scope creep during implementation
- Misaligned expectations between stakeholders and developers
- Feature requirements discovered mid-implementation
- Unclear success criteria leading to endless revisions

## Contract Creation Process

### Step 1: Stakeholder Identification

```yaml
stakeholders:
  primary:
    - role: "Product Owner"
      interests: [business value, timeline, cost]
    - role: "Tech Lead"
      interests: [technical feasibility, maintainability, security]
    - role: "End User Representative"
      interests: [usability, performance, reliability]

  secondary:
    - role: "QA Lead"
      interests: [testability, quality gates]
    - role: "Operations"
      interests: [deployability, monitoring, scalability]
```

### Step 2: Intent Clarification

**Core Questions to Address:**

1. **What** exactly are we building?
   - Specific feature boundaries
   - What is explicitly out of scope
   - User-visible behaviors only

2. **Why** are we building this?
   - Business justification
   - User problem being solved
   - Success metrics that matter

3. **Who** is this for?
   - Primary user personas
   - Secondary users affected
   - Admin/operator implications

4. **When** do we need this?
   - Business deadlines (if any)
   - Dependencies on other features
   - Integration timelines

5. **Where** does this fit?
   - System architecture impact
   - Integration touchpoints
   - Data flow implications

### Step 3: Contract Structure

```markdown
# Intent Contract: [Feature Name]

## Contract Summary
- **Feature**: [One-line description]
- **Business Value**: [Why this matters]
- **Primary User**: [Who benefits]
- **Success Definition**: [How we know it works]

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- [ ] Specific behavior 1
- [ ] Specific behavior 2
- [ ] Specific behavior 3

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- [ ] Related feature that's NOT included
- [ ] Future enhancement that's NOT included
- [ ] Edge case that's NOT handled

### Boundaries
- **Data**: What data is touched/created/modified
- **Users**: Which user types can access
- **Integrations**: What external systems are involved
- **Performance**: Minimum acceptable performance levels

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] User can [specific action] and [expected result]
- [ ] System handles [edge case] by [specific behavior]
- [ ] Integration with [system] provides [specific capability]

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Performance: [specific metric] under [specific conditions]
- [ ] Reliability: [uptime/error rate] requirements
- [ ] Security: [specific security requirements]
- [ ] Usability: [user experience standards]

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### Assumptions
- [Assumption 1 about user behavior]
- [Assumption 2 about system state]
- [Assumption 3 about external dependencies]

### Dependencies
- [External system availability]
- [Other feature completion]
- [Infrastructure requirements]

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: [Technical challenge]
  - **Probability**: [High/Medium/Low]
  - **Impact**: [High/Medium/Low]
  - **Mitigation**: [How we address it]

### Business Risks
- **Risk**: [Business challenge]
  - **Probability**: [High/Medium/Low]
  - **Impact**: [High/Medium/Low]
  - **Mitigation**: [How we address it]

## Acceptance Process

### Review Gates
1. **Business Review**: Product owner approves scope and success criteria
2. **Technical Review**: Tech lead approves feasibility and approach
3. **User Review**: User representative approves experience design
4. **Quality Review**: QA lead approves testability and quality gates

### Sign-off Requirements
- [ ] Business stakeholder approval
- [ ] Technical stakeholder approval
- [ ] User experience approval
- [ ] Quality assurance approval

### Contract Modifications
- Changes to scope require all stakeholder re-approval
- Success criteria changes require business stakeholder approval
- Technical approach changes require technical stakeholder approval

## Implementation Handoff

Once approved, this contract becomes input to:
- Implementation PRP creation (`/prp/create`)
- Technical specification development
- Project planning and estimation
- Quality assurance test planning

## Contract Validation

Before proceeding to implementation:
- [ ] All stakeholders have reviewed and approved
- [ ] Scope boundaries are crystal clear
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable and testable
- [ ] Risks are identified with mitigation plans
- [ ] Dependencies are confirmed available
- [ ] Assumptions are validated or marked for validation
```

## Output

Save as: `PRPs/contracts/intent-{feature-name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

**Naming Pattern**: intent-{feature-name}-{date}.md where:
- feature-name is kebab-case description of the feature
- date is creation date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Example: `intent-user-authentication-2024-09-22.md`

## Success Metrics

**Contract Quality Score**: Rate 1-10 for clarity and completeness

**Validation**: The completed intent contract should prevent any major scope discussions during implementation and provide clear success criteria for testing.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Vague scope definitions ("improve user experience")
- ❌ Missing stakeholder sign-offs
- ❌ Unrealistic timeline pressure
- ❌ Technical implementation details in business contract
- ❌ Unmeasurable success criteria
- ❌ Ignoring integration dependencies

## Success Indicators

- ✅ No scope questions arise during implementation
- ✅ All stakeholders have shared understanding
- ✅ Clear testing criteria emerge naturally
- ✅ Business value is measurable and tracked
- ✅ Technical approach aligns with business intent
