Create a well-structured pull request following the Release Flow branching strategy (ADR-001).

## PR Title (if provided)

$ARGUMENTS

## Release Flow Process

Follows the workflow: `feature/* ‚Üí release/* ‚Üí main`

### 1. **Branch Type Detection & Validation**

   ```bash
   # Check current branch and determine PR flow
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   echo "Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"

   # Validate branch naming convention
   case $CURRENT_BRANCH in
     feature/*)
       echo "‚úÖ Feature branch detected - will target release branch"
       TARGET_TYPE="release"
       ;;
     release/*)
       echo "‚úÖ Release branch detected - will target main"
       TARGET_TYPE="main"
       ;;
     hotfix/*)
       echo "üö® Hotfix branch detected - will target main"
       TARGET_TYPE="main"
       ;;
     main)
       echo "‚ùå Cannot create PR from main branch"
       exit 1
       ;;
     *)
       echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Non-standard branch name: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
       echo "Expected: feature/, release/, or hotfix/"
       ;;
   esac
   ```

### 2. **Determine Target Branch**

   ```bash
   if [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == feature/* ]]; then
     # Find or create appropriate release branch
     echo "Available release branches:"
     git branch -r | grep "origin/release/" || echo "No existing release branches"

     # Suggest version based on changes
     echo "Create release branch? (e.g., release/v1.1.0)"
     read -p "Enter release version or existing release branch: " RELEASE_BRANCH

     if [[ ! $RELEASE_BRANCH == release/* ]]; then
       RELEASE_BRANCH="release/$RELEASE_BRANCH"
     fi

     TARGET_BRANCH="$RELEASE_BRANCH"
   elif [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == release/* ]] || [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == hotfix/* ]]; then
     TARGET_BRANCH="main"
   fi

   echo "Target branch: $TARGET_BRANCH"
   ```

### 3. **Review Changes**

   ```bash
   # See what will be included
   git status

   # Show changes since branch point
   if [[ $TARGET_BRANCH == "main" ]]; then
     git diff main...HEAD --stat
     git log --oneline main..HEAD
   else
     # For feature branches, show all changes
     git diff HEAD~$(git rev-list --count HEAD ^main)...HEAD --stat
     git log --oneline main..HEAD
   fi
   ```

### 4. **Create Release Branch (if needed)**

   ```bash
   # Only if targeting a new release branch
   if [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == feature/* ]] && [[ ! $(git branch -r | grep "origin/$TARGET_BRANCH") ]]; then
     echo "Creating new release branch: $TARGET_BRANCH"
     git checkout -b "$TARGET_BRANCH"
     git push -u origin "$TARGET_BRANCH"

     # Return to feature branch for PR creation
     git checkout "$CURRENT_BRANCH"
   fi
   ```

### 5. **Ensure Branch is Pushed**

   ```bash
   # Ensure current branch is pushed to remote
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```

### 6. **Validate Commits**

- Commits should be logical and atomic
- Follow conventional commits format:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation
  - `test:` for tests
  - `refactor:` for refactoring
- Follow KISS/YAGNI principles (no unnecessary complexity)
- Include Claude Code attribution per project standards

### 7. **Create PR with Branch-Specific Template**

   ```bash
   # Generate appropriate PR based on branch type
   if [[ $CURRENT_BRANCH == feature/* ]]; then
     # Feature ‚Üí Release PR
     gh pr create \
       --base "$TARGET_BRANCH" \
       --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH" \
       --title "$ARGUMENTS" \
       --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

## Release Flow Best Practices

### Feature ‚Üí Release PRs

- Focus on specific feature/PRP implementation
- Include comprehensive testing
- Reference relevant PRP/ADR documents
- Ensure all PRP success criteria met

### Release ‚Üí Main PRs

- Comprehensive release overview
- List all included features/fixes
- Complete release checklist
- Plan post-merge tagging and cleanup

### Emergency Hotfixes

- Minimal scope changes only
- Thorough impact assessment
- Immediate stakeholder notification
- Plan follow-up process improvements

## Branch Protection Compliance

- **main**: Requires PR review + comprehensive tests
- **release/***: Requires comprehensive tests (allows direct commits)
- **feature/***: Requires security critical tests

Refer to [Branch Protection Guide](../../docs/guides/branch-protection.md) and [ADR-001 Branching Strategy](../../docs/adr/adr-001-branching-strategy.md) for complete details.
