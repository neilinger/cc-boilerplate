3. **Implement Terraform best practices:**
   - Use proper resource lifecycle management
   - Implement comprehensive variable validation
   - Apply security controls and encryption
   - Configure remote state with locking
   - Design for drift detection and compliance

4. **Optimize for AWS and ML workloads:**
   - Leverage AWS provider best practices
   - Optimize for Bedrock, SageMaker, and ML services
   - Implement proper IAM policies and security
   - Configure auto-scaling and cost optimization
   - Design for observability and monitoring

5. **Ensure production readiness:**
   - Implement comprehensive testing strategies
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines with approval workflows
   - Configure monitoring and alerting
   - Document architecture and operational procedures
   - Plan for maintenance and upgrade strategies
