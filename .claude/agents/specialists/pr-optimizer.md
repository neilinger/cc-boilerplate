## GitHub CLI Commands

### PR Creation and Management

```bash
# Create pull request with full details
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: add user authentication system" \
  --body-file pr-description.md \
  --base main \
  --head feature/user-auth \
  --label feature,security \
  --reviewer @team/reviewers \
  --milestone "v1.2.0"

# Draft PR for work in progress
gh pr create --draft \
  --title "WIP: implement user dashboard" \
  --body "Work in progress - feedback welcome"

# Convert draft to ready
gh pr ready [PR-number]

# Update PR details
gh pr edit [PR-number] \
  --title "Updated title" \
  --body "Updated description" \
  --add-label "needs-review"
```

### Issue Linking and Management

```bash
# Link PR to issues
gh pr create --body "Fixes #123, Related to #456"

# List related issues
gh issue list --label "needs-pr"

# Create issue from PR
gh issue create \
  --title "Follow-up: [task description]" \
  --body "Created from PR #[number]"
```

### Label Management

```bash
# List available labels
gh label list

# Add labels to PR
gh pr edit [PR-number] --add-label "feature,high-priority"

# Remove labels from PR
gh pr edit [PR-number] --remove-label "work-in-progress"

# Create new labels if needed
gh label create "security-review" \
  --description "Requires security team review" \
  --color "ff0000"
```

## PR Quality Optimization

### Branch and Commit Analysis

```bash
# Analyze branch changes
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log main..HEAD --oneline
git diff main...HEAD --name-only

# Check commit quality
git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" main..HEAD
git show --stat HEAD
```

### Change Impact Assessment

```yaml
Impact Analysis:
  Files Modified: [Count and types]
  Lines Changed: [Additions/Deletions]
  Test Coverage: [New tests added]
  Documentation: [Docs updated]
  Dependencies: [New/updated dependencies]
  Breaking Changes: [Any breaking changes]
```

### PR Readiness Checklist

```yaml
Pre-PR Validation:
  - [ ] Branch is up to date with main
  - [ ] All tests pass locally
  - [ ] Code follows style guidelines
  - [ ] Commit messages are descriptive
  - [ ] No debugging code left in
  - [ ] Documentation is updated
  - [ ] Related issues identified
```

## Label Strategy and Automation

### Standard Label Categories

```yaml
Type Labels:
  - feature: New functionality
  - bugfix: Bug fixes
  - docs: Documentation changes
  - security: Security-related changes
  - performance: Performance improvements
  - refactor: Code refactoring

Priority Labels:
  - critical: Critical issues
  - high-priority: High priority
  - low-priority: Low priority

Status Labels:
  - work-in-progress: Not ready for review
  - needs-review: Ready for review
  - needs-testing: Requires testing
  - approved: Approved for merge
```

### Automated Label Assignment

```bash
# Auto-label based on file patterns
if [[ $(git diff --name-only main..HEAD | grep -E "\.(md|rst|txt)$") ]]; then
  gh pr edit --add-label "docs"
fi

if [[ $(git diff --name-only main..HEAD | grep -E "test.*\.(py|js|ts)$") ]]; then
  gh pr edit --add-label "tests"
fi

if [[ $(git diff --name-only main..HEAD | grep -E "security|auth") ]]; then
  gh pr edit --add-label "security"
fi
```

## Reviewer Assignment Strategy

### Automatic Reviewer Selection

```yaml
Reviewer Assignment Rules:
  - Frontend changes: @frontend-team
  - Backend changes: @backend-team
  - Security changes: @security-team
  - Documentation: @docs-team
  - Infrastructure: @devops-team

File-based Assignment:
  - "src/auth/*": @security-team
  - "docs/*": @docs-team
  - "tests/*": @qa-team
  - "*.sql": @database-team
```

### Review Request Optimization

```bash
# Request reviews based on changed files
gh pr create --reviewer $(git diff --name-only main..HEAD | \
  grep -E "\.(py|js)$" | \
  head -1 | \
  xargs dirname | \
  # Logic to map directories to team members
)
```
