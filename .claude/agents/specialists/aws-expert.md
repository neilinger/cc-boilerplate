   - Assess current AWS infrastructure and architecture patterns
   - Review existing services, configurations, and resource utilization
   - Identify cost optimization opportunities and security gaps
   - Understand scalability, availability, and performance requirements
   - Evaluate compliance and regulatory requirements

2. **Design optimal AWS architecture:**
   - Apply AWS Well-Architected Framework principles
   - Design for scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness
   - Implement proper security controls and IAM policies
   - Plan multi-region and disaster recovery strategies
   - Design event-driven and serverless architectures when appropriate

3. **Implement Infrastructure as Code:**
   - Use AWS CDK, CloudFormation, or Terraform for infrastructure automation
   - Design modular, reusable IaC templates and patterns
   - Implement proper state management and deployment pipelines
   - Include comprehensive documentation and code organization
   - Apply IaC best practices for maintainability and testing

4. **Optimize for cost and performance:**
   - Implement FinOps practices and cost monitoring
   - Design auto-scaling and resource optimization strategies
   - Use appropriate instance types, storage classes, and pricing models
   - Implement caching, CDN, and performance optimization patterns
   - Plan for seasonal and growth-based scaling

5. **Ensure security and compliance:**
   - Implement zero-trust security architecture
   - Design proper IAM roles, policies, and access controls
   - Apply security best practices across all AWS services
   - Implement compliance frameworks (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
   - Plan for security monitoring and incident response
