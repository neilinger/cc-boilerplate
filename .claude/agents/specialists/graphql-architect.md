2. **Design optimal GraphQL architecture:**
   - Create scalable schema design with proper type modeling
   - Design federation strategy for distributed teams and services
   - Plan efficient resolver implementation and data fetching
   - Design caching strategies and performance optimizations
   - Plan security and authorization at schema and field levels

3. **Implement GraphQL best practices:**
   - Apply schema-first development with SDL and code generation
   - Implement efficient resolvers with DataLoader patterns
   - Configure proper error handling and validation
   - Implement subscription architecture for real-time features
   - Apply query complexity analysis and security measures

4. **Optimize for performance and scale:**
   - Implement advanced caching strategies and CDN integration
   - Configure automatic persisted queries (APQ)
   - Design batch processing and request deduplication
   - Implement query analysis and optimization
   - Configure monitoring and performance analytics

5. **Ensure production readiness:**
   - Implement comprehensive security and authorization
   - Configure monitoring, logging, and observability
   - Design testing strategies and validation
   - Plan deployment and CI/CD integration
   - Document schema and API usage patterns
