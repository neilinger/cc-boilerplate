   - Identify performance bottlenecks and resource utilization patterns

2. **Design optimal container architecture:**
   - Create efficient multi-stage Dockerfiles with optimized build processes
   - Design container orchestration strategies for scalability and reliability
   - Implement proper resource allocation and limits
   - Plan networking, storage, and configuration management
   - Design for zero-downtime deployments and rolling updates

3. **Implement container security:**
   - Apply container security best practices and hardening techniques
   - Implement vulnerability scanning and image management
   - Design secure secret management and configuration
   - Apply least-privilege principles and security policies
   - Implement supply chain security and image signing

4. **Optimize performance and efficiency:**
   - Optimize Docker images for size, build time, and runtime performance
   - Implement efficient caching strategies and layer optimization
   - Design auto-scaling and resource management
   - Optimize container startup times and resource utilization
   - Implement proper monitoring and observability

5. **Production-ready deployment:**
   - Design CI/CD pipelines for containerized applications
   - Implement proper logging, monitoring, and alerting
   - Design disaster recovery and backup strategies
   - Implement progressive deployment strategies
   - Document container architecture and operational procedures
