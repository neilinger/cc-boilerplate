# Implementation Plan: CC-Boilerplate Strategic Accelerator Framework

**Branch**: `002-prps-prd-cc` | **Date**: 2025-01-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-prps-prd-cc/spec.md`
**Constitutional Version**: v1.2.0 (TDD, Enhanced KISS/YAGNI, Security-First)

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on Constitutional v1.2.0
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md (via agent coordination)
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md update
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Scale/Scope**: 100+ specialized agents, supporting 50+ concurrent projects, zero constitutional violations

## Constitution Check v1.2.0
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. KISS/YAGNI Supremacy ✓
- **One function = one job**: Each agent has single, clear responsibility ✓
- **Simple data structures**: File-based storage with JSON/YAML configs ✓
- **Clear naming**: Agent names describe function (test-automator, security-scanner) ✓
- **No premature abstraction**: Building only what's needed for current requirements ✓
- **95% certainty rule**: All features justified by specific FR requirements ✓

### II. Security-First Architecture ✓
- **Mandatory security chain**: All code changes through code-reviewer → security-orchestrator ✓
- **Tool least privilege**: Analyzers read-only, specialists domain-restricted ✓
- **Protection systems**: 30+ dangerous patterns blocked with real-time validation ✓

### III. Hierarchical Agent Orchestration (ADR-007) ✓
- **Dynamic agent discovery**: workflow-orchestrator for complex tasks ✓
- **Cognitive load optimization**: Haiku/Sonnet/Opus allocation by complexity ✓
- **Agent boundaries**: No capability overlap, clear handoff patterns ✓
- **Constitutional compliance**: Continuous validation via check-agents.sh ✓

### IV. Validation-Driven Development ✓
- **95% certainty rule**: All decisions validated with sequential thinking ✓
- **PRP structure**: Clear scope definition preventing scope creep ✓
- **Sequential thinking**: Every step challenged against KISS/YAGNI ✓

### V. Test-Driven Development (TDD) ✓
- **Tests before implementation**: All agent logic TDD-validated ✓
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Constitutional compliance tests first ✓
- **Coverage requirements**: Critical paths tested, gaps identified ✓
- **TDD enforcement**: Tasks ordered tests-first by constitutional requirement ✓

**Structure Decision**: Single project optimized for constitutional compliance and agent orchestration

## Phase 0: Constitutional Research & Validation

### Agent-Coordinated Research (via workflow-orchestrator)
1. **Constitutional Compliance Analysis** (technical-researcher):
   - Validate TDD integration with hierarchical agent architecture
   - Research multi-agent TDD patterns and validation strategies
   - Analyze security-first development for agent systems

2. **IP and Competitive Analysis** (the-librarian):
   - AI-first turnaround consulting methodology positioning
   - Multi-agent framework differentiation strategies
   - Constitutional AI integration patterns

3. **Architecture Validation** (adr-creator):
   - ADR-009: TDD Integration with Hierarchical Agent Architecture
   - Constitutional compliance architecture decisions
   - Security boundary validation patterns

4. **Security Pattern Research** (security-orchestrator):
   - Agent permission boundary enforcement
   - Constitutional security chain validation
   - Risk mitigation for multi-agent systems

**Output**: research.md with constitutional compliance validation and agent coordination patterns

## Phase 1: Constitutional Design & Architecture

### TDD-First Architecture Design
1. **Constitutional Test Suite** (test-automator):
   - Agent orchestration compliance tests
   - Security chain validation tests
   - KISS/YAGNI complexity metric tests
   - TDD enforcement validation tests

2. **Agent System Data Model** (Following Constitutional v1.2.0):
   - Hierarchical agent entity structure
   - Security chain workflow entities
   - Constitutional compliance tracking
   - TDD validation metadata

3. **Security-First API Contracts**:
   - Agent discovery and orchestration APIs
   - Security validation chain APIs
   - Constitutional compliance monitoring APIs
   - TDD enforcement tracking APIs

4. **Constitutional Quickstart Guide**:
   - TDD-first agent development workflow
   - Security chain integration process
   - Constitutional compliance validation steps

5. **CLAUDE.md Update** (constitutional compliance):
   - Integration with Constitutional v1.2.0 principles
   - Agent orchestration guidance updates
   - TDD workflow documentation

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/*, quickstart.md, updated CLAUDE.md, constitutional test suite

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach (Constitutional TDD)
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy (TDD-First)**:
- Load constitutional compliance requirements as primary constraint
- Generate TDD validation tasks before implementation tasks
- Each agent → constitutional compliance test → implementation test → agent logic
- Security chain → validation tests → chain implementation → integration tests
- Orchestration → workflow tests → coordination logic → end-to-end validation

**Constitutional Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Constitutional tests → Implementation tests → Logic (mandatory)
- Security first: Security validation before any implementation
- Agent boundaries: Clear separation validated before integration
- Complexity validation: KISS/YAGNI metrics before feature completion

**Estimated Output**: 40-50 numbered, TDD-ordered tasks with constitutional validation gates

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Constitutional task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: TDD implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Constitutional validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, compliance validation)

## Agent Coordination Matrix

### Phase 0 Agents (Orchestrated)
- **workflow-orchestrator**: Coordinate all phase 0 research activities
- **technical-researcher**: Multi-agent TDD patterns and constitutional compliance
- **the-librarian**: IP analysis and competitive positioning
- **adr-creator**: ADR-009 creation for constitutional architecture
- **security-orchestrator**: Security pattern research and validation

### Phase 1 Agents (Coordinated)
- **test-automator**: Constitutional compliance test suite creation
- **smart-doc-generator**: Documentation updates for constitutional compliance
- **api-architect**: Security-first API contract design
- **code-reviewer**: Design review for constitutional adherence
- **security-orchestrator**: Final security validation

## Complexity Tracking
*Constitutional v1.2.0 compliance - No violations detected*

All design decisions align with Constitutional v1.2.0 principles:
