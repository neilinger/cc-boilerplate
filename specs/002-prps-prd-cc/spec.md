## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a turnaround specialist or AI-first consultant, I need a comprehensive development framework that enables rapid project recovery and MVP creation within 6 hours, transforming chaotic brown-field projects or green-field opportunities into production-ready systems with enterprise-grade quality and security.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a brown-field project with accumulated technical debt and lost focus, **When** the turnaround specialist applies CC-Boilerplate framework, **Then** the system analyzes existing code, generates missing specifications, establishes security boundaries, and delivers a working MVP within 6 hours
2. **Given** a consulting engagement requiring Day 1 productivity, **When** the AI-first consultant initializes with CC-Boilerplate, **Then** the system provides 100+ specialized agents, automated quality gates, and PRP discovery workflow enabling immediate productive development
3. **Given** a rough idea for an internal portfolio tool, **When** the portfolio builder uses PRP discovery, **Then** the system transforms the idea into comprehensive requirements, generates specifications, and enables rapid AWS deployment with Linear integration
4. **Given** a messy git workflow with mixed implementations, **When** the developer uses mid-journey course correction, **Then** the system intelligently splits commits, repairs branch workflow, and restores clean state without losing work
5. **Given** a complex multi-step task requiring coordination, **When** the workflow-orchestrator is invoked, **Then** it dynamically discovers and coordinates specialist agents, maintains security chains, and delivers coordinated results
6. **[PRIORITY TEST]** **Given** CLAUDE.md is modified with new behavioral directives, **When** regression tests execute, **Then** the system validates behavioral consistency, detects degradations, and reports role adherence metrics with >95% detection accuracy

### Edge Cases

- What happens when agent selection is ambiguous between multiple specialists?
- How does system handle recovery when multiple security violations are detected simultaneously?
- What happens when Linear integration fails during AI-human task allocation?
- How does system handle conflicting requirements discovered during PRP reverse-engineering?
- What happens when cognitive load model suggests different agent than workflow requirements?
- [PRIORITY] What happens when behavioral tests show degradation in CEO role adherence?
- How does system handle conflicting behavioral directives in CLAUDE.md?
- What is the rollback mechanism when behavioral regression is detected?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_
