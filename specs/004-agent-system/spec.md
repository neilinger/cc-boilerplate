# Feature Specification: Hierarchical Agent System

## Overview

**Feature Goal**: Transform the Claude Code sub-agent system from flat agent delegation to hierarchical orchestration with autonomous agent selection, security-first tool allocation, and proactive quality assurance through soft hooks.

**Deliverable**:
- Hierarchical orchestration system with primary orchestrator agents
- Security-based tool allocation matrix with role-based permissions
- Missing critical agents (debugger, security-scanner, dependency-manager, pr-optimizer, context-engineer)
- Soft hook system for drift prevention
- Cognitive load-based model allocation strategy
- Agent orchestration chains for common workflows

**Success Definition**:
- Agents autonomously coordinate in chains (code-reviewer → security-scanner → test-automator)
- Tool permissions enforced by role (read-only agents cannot edit)
- Proactive quality hooks prevent issues before they occur
- Model allocation optimizes cost vs complexity
- One-pass implementation success through comprehensive context

## Business Value

- **Business Value**: Prevents security vulnerabilities and code quality issues before they reach production
- **Integration**: Extends existing Claude Code agent system with minimal breaking changes
- **Problems Solved**:
  - Eliminates manual agent coordination
  - Prevents tool access security vulnerabilities
  - Reduces technical debt through proactive quality hooks
  - Optimizes AI model costs through cognitive load matching
  - Fills critical workflow gaps with missing agents

## Functional Requirements

### User-Visible Behavior
- Agents automatically coordinate in predefined chains for common workflows
- Security-sensitive operations require explicit confirmation
- Proactive quality suggestions appear before problems occur
- Model selection happens transparently based on task complexity
- Comprehensive validation occurs before code reaches production

### Technical Requirements
- Hierarchical orchestration layer above current agent system
- Role-based tool permission enforcement
- Soft hook system that integrates with existing Claude Code hooks
- Dynamic model allocation based on cognitive complexity
- Agent chain configuration and execution engine

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Primary orchestrator agents coordinate multi-agent workflows automatically
- [ ] Tool permissions enforced - read-only agents cannot use Write/Edit/Bash tools
- [ ] Soft hooks trigger proactive quality chains on code changes
- [ ] Model allocation matches cognitive complexity (haiku→sonnet→opus)
- [ ] Missing agents (debugger, security-scanner, etc.) fill workflow gaps
- [ ] Agent chains execute reliably with fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Security boundaries prevent unauthorized tool access across agents
- [ ] Performance maintains sub-2-second agent selection times
- [ ] Cost optimization through appropriate model allocation
- [ ] Integration preserves existing agent functionality

## Context and Constraints

This is a complex system transformation that requires careful consideration of:

- **Existing Agent System**: Current flat delegation model needs gradual migration
- **Security Boundaries**: Tool access must be strictly controlled by role
- **Performance Requirements**: Agent selection must remain fast (<2 seconds)
- **Cost Optimization**: Model allocation based on cognitive load complexity
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality must be preserved

**Key Technical Context**:
- ADR-007: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Architecture provides the foundation
- ADR-008: Cognitive Load Model Allocation guides resource optimization
- Security-first approach with mandatory validation chains
- Integration with existing Claude Code hooks system
